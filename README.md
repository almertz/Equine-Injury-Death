# Equine-Injury-Death
Analysis of deaths and injuries of racing thoroughbreds, including where and how they occur at four New York racetracks. A decrease in fatal injuries, primarily fractures, is a large factor in an overall 29.7% decrease in fatal incidents from 2009 to 2023.

Analysis was performed in Power BI, using Python to import data so that incident description strings could be parsed to create new features describing injuries and verify outcomes.
